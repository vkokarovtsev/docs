## What is included in {{ yagpt-full-name }} cost {#rules}

### Pricing unit {#unit}

A pricing unit means a single billing unit. The cost of a billing unit is different for text generation and vectorization.

### Text generation {#rules-generating}

Text generation cost is based on the overall number of [prompt](concepts/index.md#working-mode) and response [tokens](concepts/tokens.md) and depends on the {{ yagpt-full-name }} request parameters. Namely, the cost depends on these parameters:

* Model that is requested.
* Model working mode.

The number of prompt and response tokens for the same text may vary depending on the specific model.

The number of billing units is based on the overall number of prompt and response tokens and is rounded up to a whole number after applying the multiplier.

### Text vectorization {#rules-embedding}

The cost of providing text as vectors, i.e., getting text embeddings, depends on the size of the text being vectorized.

### Internal server errors {#error-request}

## Examples of {{ yagpt-full-name }} usage cost calculation {#price-examples}

### Calculating text generation cost {#price-example-generating}

> In this example, we will calculate the cost of using {{ yagpt-name }} for text generation with the following parameters:
> * Number of prompt tokens: 20.
> * Number of response tokens: 32.
> * Model: {{ yagpt-name }} Lite.
> * Model working mode: Synchronous.
>
> The cost is calculated as follows:
>
> (20 + 32) × 1.0 × ($0.0032/1000) = $0.000166
>
> Total: $0.000166.

Where:
* 20: Number of prompt tokens.
* 32: Number of response tokens.
* 1.0: Multiplier for using the {{ yagpt-name }} Lite model in synchronous mode.
* $0.0032: Cost per 1,000 tokens.
* $0.0032/1000: Cost per token.


> Here is another example, where we will calculate the cost of using {{ yagpt-name }} for text generation with the following parameters:
> * Number of prompt tokens: 115.
> * Number of response tokens: 1,500.
> * Model: {{ yagpt-name }}.
> * Model working mode: Asynchronous.
>
> The cost is calculated as follows:
>
> (115 + 1500) × 2.5 = 4037.5 = 4038.0 (rounding up to the integer)
> 4038.0 × ($0.0032/1000) = $0.012922
>
> Total: $0.012922.

Where:
* 115: Number of prompt tokens.
* 1500: Number of response tokens.
* 2.5: Multiplier for using the {{ yagpt-name }} model in asynchronous mode.
* 4038.0: Total number of billing units.
* $0.0032: Cost per 1,000 tokens.
* $0.0032/1000: Cost per token.

### Calculating text vectorization cost {#price-example-embedding}

> In this example, we will calculate the cost of using {{ yagpt-name }} for text vectorization with the following parameters:
> * Number of tokens in the request: 2,000.
>
> The cost is calculated as follows:
>
> 2000 × 1.0 × ($0.00008/1000) = $0.00016
>
> Total: $0.00016.

Where:
* 2000: Number of tokens in the request.
* 1.0: Multiplier for using text vectorization.
* $0.00008: Cost per 1,000 tokens.
* $0.00008/1000: Cost per token.
