# GeeseFS

[GeeseFS](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs) is a utility for mounting {{ objstorage-name }} buckets using [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) on Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms. It was developed by the {{ yandex-cloud }} team as a fork of [goofys](goofys.md). It is a high-performance, POSIX-ish file system.

## Functionality {#features}

### Performance {#performance}

Compared to goofys and [s3fs](s3fs.md), GeeseFS handles large amounts of small files (up to 1 MB) much faster and achieves similar or higher performance with large files. For more information about benchmark tests, see the [GeeseFS repository on GitHub](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/tree/master/bench).

To make GeeseFS run faster, it implements:

* Parallel readahead.
* Heuristic readahead for random access: if the size of multiple blocks requested in a row is below the threshold, GeeseFS downloads smaller blocks from storage for upcoming requests.
* Parallel [multipart uploads](../concepts/multipart.md) of objects to storage.
* Optimized object updates: the client and repository only exchange modified object parts.
* Background uploads of small object trees and [directories](../concepts/object.md#folder): when a directory is requested, GeeseFS downloads the whole tree per request to storage.
* Asynchronous object write, rename, and delete.
* Disk cache for reads and writes.

### POSIX compatibility {#posix-compatibility}

In addition to the basic functions of the POSIX standards (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, and so on), GeeseFS supports the following features:

* Read-after-write consistency.
* Partial writes (please note that partial writes in buckets with [versioning](../concepts/versioning.md) may result in intermediate object versions).
* `fsync`: Synchronization of the contents of an object or directory between the VM memory and storage.
* `truncate`: Arbitrary change in the size of an object.
* Soft links (symlinks).
* `xattr`: Extended file attributes.
* Directory renames.
* `readdir`: Reads of directory metadata.

### Partial updating and appending of objects data {#patch}

GeeseFS supports [partial updating and appending of objects data](../concepts/object-patch.md) to {{ objstorage-name }} buckets.

To enable partial object updates, use the `--enable-patch` option.

To learn more, see the GeeseFS repository on GitHub:
* [Partial object updates](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs#partial-object-updates-patch): Description of partial updating and appending of objects data.
* [Concurrent Updates](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs#concurrent-patch): Description of how an object can be partially updated by multiple concurrent requests.

### Limitations {#restrictions}

GeeseFS does not support the following:

* Working with file and directory access rights, including `chmod` and `chown`.

   When mounting the file system, you can specify:

   * Access rights to all files or directories in the `--file-mode` and `--dir-mode` values, respectively.
   * The ID of the user that is the owner of all files and directories in the `--uid` value.
   * The ID of the group that all files and directories belong to in the `--gid` value.

   For example:

   ```bash
   geesefs \
     --file-mode=0666 \
     --dir-mode=0777 \
     --uid=1000 \
     <bucket_name> <mount_point>
   ```

* Hard links.
* File locking.
* The correct time that shows when a file was last accessed (`atime`) and when the file attributes were last changed (`ctime`). Both fields always contain the time of the file's last modification: the same as in the `mtime` field.
* Creating files larger than 1 TB.

      chmod a+x geesefs-mac-$platform
      sudo cp geesefs-mac-$platform /usr/bin/geesefs
      ```

- Windows {#windows}

You can also build GeeseFS yourself using its source code. For more information, see the [guide](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs#installation) in the GeeseFS repository on GitHub.

## Authentication {#authentication}

GeeseFS uses a [static access key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md) for {{ objstorage-name }}. You can set it using one of the following methods:

{% list tabs group=operating_system %}

- Linux/macOS {#linux-macos}

   * Using a `credentials` [file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) placed in the `~/.aws/` folder:

      ```text
      [default]
        aws_access_key_id=<key_ID>
        aws_secret_access_key=<secret_key>
      ```

      If the key file is located elsewhere, specify its path in the `--shared-config` parameter when mounting the bucket:

      ```bash
      geesefs \
        --shared-config <path_to_key_file> \
        <bucket_name> <mount_point>
      ```

   * Using environment variables:

      ```bash
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key_ID>
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_key>
      ```

   {% note info %}

   You can run the `geesefs` command with superuser privileges (`sudo`). In this case, make sure to send information about the key either in the `--shared-config` parameter or using environment variables.

   {% endnote %}

- Windows {#windows}

   * Using a [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) `file` placed in the `users/<current_user>/.aws/` folder:

      ```text
      [default]
        aws_access_key_id=<key_ID>
        aws_secret_access_key=<secret_key>
      ```

      If the key file is located elsewhere, specify its path in the `--shared-config` parameter when mounting the bucket:

      ```cmd
      geesefs <bucket_name> <mount_point> ^
        --shared-config <path_to_key_file>
      ```

   * Using environment variables:

      ```cmd
      set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key_ID>
      set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_key>
      ```

{% endlist %}

When using GeeseFS on a {{ compute-name }} VM that has a [linked service account](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm.md#link-sa-with-instance), you can enable simplified authentication that does not require a static access key. To do this, when mounting a bucket, use the `--iam` option.

## Mounting a bucket {#bucket-mounting}

Select the folder or disk where you want to mount the bucket. Make sure you have sufficient rights to perform this operation.

When mounting a bucket, you can also configure GeeseFS settings related to system [performance](#performance) and object access rights. To view the list of options and their descriptions, run `geesefs --help`.

* For one-time bucket mounting, run the following command:

   ```bash
   geesefs <bucket_name> <mount_point>
   ```

* To automatically mount a bucket at system startup:

   {% list tabs group=operating_system %}

   - Linux/macOS {#linux-macos}

      1. Add the following line to `/etc/fuse.conf`:

         ```text
         user_allow_other
         ```

      1. Add a line in the following format to `/etc/fstab`:

         ```text
         <bucket_name>    <mount_point>    fuse.geesefs    _netdev,allow_other,--file-mode=0666,--dir-mode=0777    0   0
         ```

      {% note info %}

      To ensure that the bucket is mounted correctly, provide the full absolute path to the mount point without `~`. For example, `/home/user/mountpoint`.

      {% endnote %}

   - Windows {#windows}

      Create a Windows service that will automatically run at system startup:

      1. Open the Command Prompt (`CMD`) as an administrator.
      1. Run this command:

         ```cmd
         sc create <service_name> ^
           binPath="<mount_command>" ^
           DisplayName= "<service_name>" ^
           type=own ^
           start=auto
         ```

         Where `binPath` is the path to `geesefs.exe` with your mount parameters. For example, `C:\geesefs\geesefs.exe <bucket_name> <mount_point>`.

         Result:

         ```text
         [SC] CreateService: Success
         ```

      1. Click **Start** and start typing `Services` in the Windows search bar. Run the **Services** application as an administrator.
      1. In the window that opens, find the service you created earlier, right-click it, and select **Properties**.
      1. On the **Log on** tab, select **This account** and specify your Windows account name and password.

         If necessary, click **Browse** → **Advanced** → **Search** to find the user you need on the computer.

      1. Click **OK**.

      To delete the created service, open the Command Prompt (`CMD`) as an administrator and run the following command:

      ```cmd
      sc delete <service_name>
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      [SC] DeleteService: Success
      ```

   {% endlist %}
