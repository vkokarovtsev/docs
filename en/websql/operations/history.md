# Query history

{% include notitle [preview](../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}

In the query history, you can see all SQL queries executed in your {{ yandex-cloud }} [organization](../../organization/concepts/manage-services.md) within the current connection session. You can view and repeat your previously executed queries:

1. Go to the **Query history** section (![image](../../_assets/console-icons/clock-arrow-rotate-left.svg)). Successful queries are marked with ![image](../../_assets/websql/success.svg), failed queries are marked with ![image](../../_assets/websql/failed.svg).

   {% include [search-tip](../../_includes/websql/search-tip.md) %}

1. Select a query: it will show up in the data panel.

1. Click **Execute** to repeat this query.

You can [edit the query parameters](query-executor.md) or [save your query as a template](templates.md).
