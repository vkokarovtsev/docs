# Removing a user from a space

To remove users from a space, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role for the space. Once removed, they will not be able to access the space as well as the connections and projects within it.

To remove a user from a space:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select the **Team** tab.
1. In the line with the username, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **Delete**.
1. Confirm user deletion.
