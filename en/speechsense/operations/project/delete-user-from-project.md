# Removing a user from a project

To remove a user from a project, you need the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` role for this project or the space the project belongs to. Once removed, the user will not be able to access the project.

To remove a user from a project:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select the appropriate project.
1. Go to the **Team** tab.
1. In the line with the username, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/trash-bin.svg) **Delete**.
1. Confirm user deletion.
