# Resource relationships in {{ data-transfer-name }}

{{ data-transfer-full-name }} helps transfer data between DBMS, object storages, and message brokers. This way you can reduce the migration period and minimize downtime when switching to a new database.

{{ data-transfer-full-name }} is configurable via {{ yandex-cloud }} standard interfaces.

The service is suitable for creating a permanent replica of the database. The transfer of the database schema from the source to the target is automated.

## Endpoint {#endpoint}

_Endpoint_ is a configuration used to connect to the _datasource_ service or _target_ service. In addition to connection settings, the endpoint may contain information about which data will be involved in the transfer and how it should be processed during the transfer.

The following can be the data source or target:

## Transfer {#transfer}

_Transfer_ is the process of transmitting data between the source and target service. It should be in the same folder as the endpoints used.

If subnets are specified for endpoints, these subnets must be hosted in the same [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md). Otherwise, activating the transfer with such endpoints will result in an error.
