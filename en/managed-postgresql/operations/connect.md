# Connecting to a database in a {{ PG }} cluster

You can connect to {{ mpg-short-name }} cluster hosts:

{% include [cluster-connect-note](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/cluster-connect-note.md) %}

{% note warning %}

If only some cluster hosts have public access configured, the master may not be accessible from the internet when it [changes automatically](../concepts/replication.md#replication-auto).

{% endnote %}


## Configuring security groups {#configuring-security-groups}

{% include [sg-rules](../../_includes/mdb/sg-rules-connect.md) %}

Rule settings depend on the connection method you select:

{% list tabs %}

- Over the internet

   [Configure all security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in your cluster to allow incoming traffic on port 6432 from any IP. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic:

   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `6432`
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_tcp }}`
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
   * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

- With a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }}

   1. [Configure all security groups](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) in your cluster to allow incoming traffic on port 6432 from the security group where the VM is located. To do this, create the following rule for incoming traffic in these groups:

      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `6432`
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_tcp }}`
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-sg }}`
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-sg-type }}**: If your cluster and VM are in the same security group, select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-sg-type-self }}` (`Self`) as the value. Otherwise, specify the VM security group.

   1. [Configure the security group](../../vpc/operations/security-group-add-rule.md) where the VM is located to enable connections to the VM and traffic between the VM and the cluster hosts.

      For example, you can set the following rules for a VM:

      * For incoming traffic:
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `22`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.label_tcp }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-source }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

         This rule allows you to [connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to the VM over SSH.

      * For outgoing traffic:
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-port-range }}**: `{{ port-any }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-protocol }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_any }}` (`Any`)
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-destination }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.value_sg-rule-destination-cidr }}`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.security-groups.forms.field_sg-rule-cidr-blocks }}**: `0.0.0.0/0`

         This rule allows all outgoing traffic, which enables you to both connect to the cluster and install the certificates and utilities the VMs need to connect to the cluster.

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You can set more detailed rules for security groups, such as allowing traffic in only specific subnets.

Security groups must be configured correctly for all subnets that will include cluster hosts. If security group settings are incomplete or incorrect, you may lose access to the cluster if the master is switched [manually](hosts.md#update) or [automatically](../concepts/replication.md#replication-auto).

{% endnote %}

For more information about security groups, see [{#T}](../concepts/network.md#security-groups).


## Getting an SSL certificate {#get-ssl-cert}

{{ PG }} hosts with public access only support encrypted connections. To use them, get an SSL certificate:

{% include [install-certificate](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/install-certificate.md) %}

{% include [ide-ssl-cert](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-ssl-cert.md) %}

## {{ PG }} host FQDN {#fqdn}

To connect to a host, you need its fully qualified domain name ([FQDN](../concepts/network.md#hostname)). You can obtain it in one of the following ways:

* [Request a list of cluster hosts](../operations/hosts.md#list-hosts).
* In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), copy the command for connecting to the cluster. This command contains the host FQDN. To get the command, go to the cluster page and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.overview.button_action-connect }}**.
* Look up the FQDN in the management console:

   1. Go to the cluster page.
   1. Go to **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}**.
   1. Copy the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.host_column_name }}** column value.

Cluster hosts also use [special FQDNs](#special-fqdns).

## Special FQDNs {#special-fqdns}

Alongside [regular FQDNs](#fqdn), {{ mpg-name }} provides several special FQDNs, which can also be used when connecting to a cluster.

{% note warning %}

If, when the [master host is changed automatically](../concepts/replication.md#replication-auto), a host with no public access becomes a new master or the most recent replica, you will not be able to access them from the internet. To avoid this, [enable public access](hosts.md#update) for all cluster hosts.

{% endnote %}

### Current master {#fqdn-master}

Such FQDN as `c-<cluster_ID>.rw.{{ dns-zone }}` always points to the current cluster master host. You can request the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

When connecting to this FQDN, both read and write operations are allowed.

{% note info %}

Connect using special master host FQDNs to make sure your cluster is available even after a master fail over.

{% endnote %}

Here is an example of connecting to a master host for a cluster with the `c9qash3nb1v9********` ID:

```bash
psql "host=c-c9qash3nb1v9********.rw.{{ dns-zone }} \
      port=6432 \
      sslmode=verify-full \
      dbname=<DB_name> \
      user=<username> \
      target_session_attrs=read-write"
```

### Most recent replica {#fqdn-replica}

Such FQDN as `c-<cluster_ID>.ro.{{ dns-zone }}` points to the most recent [replica](../concepts/replication.md), i.e., the one most up-to-date with the master host. You can request the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

**Specifics:**

* When connecting to this FQDN, only read operations are allowed.
* If there are no active replicas in the cluster, this FQDN will point to the current master host.

Here is an example of connecting to the most recent replica for a cluster with the `c9qash3nb1v9********` ID:

```bash
psql "host=c-c9qash3nb1v9********.ro.{{ dns-zone }} \
      port=6432 \
      sslmode=verify-full \
      dbname=<DB_name> \
      user=<username> \
      target_session_attrs=any"
```

## Automatic master host selection {#automatic-master-host-selection}

To guarantee a connection to the master host:

1. In the `host` argument, provide one of the following:

   * [Special master host FQDN](#fqdn-master) as shown in the [examples below](#connection-string).
   * [FQDNs](#fqdn) of all cluster hosts.

1. Provide the `target_session_attrs=read-write` parameter. This parameter is supported by the `libpq` library starting with [version 10](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/libpq-connect.html).

To upgrade the library version used by the `psql` utility:

* For Debian-based Linux distributions, install the `postgresql-client-10` package or higher (for example, using an [APT repository](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)).
* For operating systems that use RPM packages, use the {{ PG }} distribution available from the [yum repository](https://yum.postgresql.org/).

## Connecting from graphical IDEs {#connection-ide}

{% include [ide-environments](../../_includes/mdb/mdb-ide-envs.md) %}

You can only use graphical IDEs to connect to public cluster hosts using SSL certificates.

{% include [note-connection-ide](../../_includes/mdb/note-connection-ide.md) %}

{% list tabs %}

- DataGrip

   1. Create a data source:
      1. Select **File** → **New** → **Data Source** → **{{ PG }}**.

   * **Client certificate**: Select the `cert.pem` file.
   * **Client private key**: Select the `private.pem` file.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

## Before you connect from a Docker container {#connection-docker}

To connect to a {{ mpg-name }} cluster from a Docker container, add the following lines to the Dockerfile:

{% list tabs %}


* Connecting without using SSL

   ```bash
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install postgresql-client --yes
   ```


* Connecting via SSL

   ```bash
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install wget postgresql-client --yes && \
       mkdir --parents ~/.postgresql && \
       wget "{{ crt-web-path }}" \
            --output-document ~/.postgresql/root.crt && \
       chmod 0600 ~/.postgresql/root.crt
   ```

{% endlist %}

## Sample connection strings {#connection-string}

{% include [conn-strings-environment](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-conn-strings-env.md) %}

You can only connect to publicly accessible {{ PG }} hosts using an SSL certificate. Prior to connecting to such hosts, [generate a certificate](#get-ssl-cert).

The examples below assume that the `root.crt` SSL certificate is located in the directory:

* `/home/<home_directory>/.postgresql/` for Ubuntu.
* `$HOME\AppData\Roaming\postgresql` for Windows.

Connecting without an SSL certificate is only supported for hosts that are not publicly accessible. If this is the case, internal cloud network traffic will not be encrypted for connecting to a database.

You can connect to a cluster using both regular host [FQDNs](../concepts/network.md#hostname) (you can send a comma-separated list consisting of several such FQDNs) and [special FQDNs](#special-fqdns). The examples use a special FQDN of the current master host.

{% include [see-fqdn-in-console](../../_includes/mdb/see-fqdn-in-console.md) %}

{% include [mpg-connection-strings](../../_includes/mdb/mpg-conn-strings.md) %}

If the connection to the cluster and the test query are successful, the {{ PG }} version is output.
