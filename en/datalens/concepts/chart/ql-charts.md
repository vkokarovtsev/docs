# QL charts. Overview


_QL charts_ are charts created from a connection if the connection source is a database, {{ prometheus-name }}, or {{ monitoring-short-name }}. To create such charts, direct queries to the source are used. Depending on the chart type, the query can be run in the source database's SQL dialect, as well as the {{ prometheus-name }} or {{ monitoring-short-name }} query languages. This helps you to expand visualization capabilities by using language-specific transactions.


Running a query does not create a separate [Dataset](../dataset/index.md) object: a chart is generated on the fly and displayed in the preview panel.

Unlike [dataset-based charts](dataset-based-charts.md), the logic of a visualization area in QL charts favors queries against the source, that is, the visualization area only displays the data from the query.


{% note alert %}

If users are granted [permission to view](../../security/manage-access#permission-read) your QL chart, they will be able to make any queries to any source data of this QL chart.

{% endnote %}

The following types of QL charts are supported:

* **SQL**. These allow you to build visualizations with flexible dataset management based on parameterization of an SQL query to the source DB.

   SQL charts have the following features:

   * Reduce database workload by using direct queries.
   * Only suitable for `SELECT` queries.
   * Enable the use of `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `SORT BY` queries and aggregate functions in SQL queries.
   * Enable the parameterization of any part of a SQL query.
   * Support a limited set of [visualizations types](../../visualization-ref/index.md).
   * They do not support [RLS](../../security/row-level-security.md) and [calculated fields](../calculations/index.md).

* **{{ prometheus-name }}**. These allow you to create a chart based on {{ prometheus-name }}. You cannot build a dataset on top of this source. You can only work with it using QL charts.

   {% include [datalens-prometheus-ch-example](../../../_includes/datalens/datalens-prometheus-ch-example.md) %}

* **{{ monitoring-short-name }}**. These allow you to create a chart based on {{ monitoring-full-name }}. You cannot build a dataset on top of this source. You can only work with it using QL charts.
