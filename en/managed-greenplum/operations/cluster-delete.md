- Management console

   1. Go to the [folder page]({{ link-console-main }}) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-greenplum }}**.
   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) for the cluster you need and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.clusters.button_action-delete }}**.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To delete a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-gp }} cluster delete <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```

   You can request the cluster ID and name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- {{ TF }}

   To delete the infrastructure created with {{ TF }}:

   1. In the terminal window, go to the directory containing the infrastructure plan.
   1. Delete the {{ TF }} configuration file of the desired cluster.
   1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform validate
      ```

      If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Confirm updating the resources.

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

      All the resources described in the configuration file will be deleted.

   {% include [Terraform timeouts](../../_includes/mdb/mch/terraform/timeouts.md) %}

- API

   To delete a cluster, use the [delete](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Delete](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
