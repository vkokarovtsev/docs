# {{ wiki-full-name }}

You can insert _magic links_ on Wiki pages to individual issues and issue lists. These links always include the key, name, status of the issue, and the assignee's username.

## Inserting a link to an issue {#section_hws_qzr_3bb}

To insert a link to an issue, copy its key and paste it in the text of the page:

| Example | Result |
| ----- | ----- |
| ``` TEST-123 ``` | ![](../../_assets/tracker/magic-link.png) |

Magic links to issues aren't just for {{ wiki-full-name }} pages. They also work in other internet services that support Wiki markup.
