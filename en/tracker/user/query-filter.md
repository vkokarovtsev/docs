# Query language in {{ tracker-name }}

If you want to do more than simple filters allow, set a filter using a query language.

The query language allows you to:

* Search for issues [by name, description, and comment](#query-text).

* Filter issues [by multiple values of a single field](#query-multiple-values).

* Use the [comparison operators](#query-compare) and [logical operators](#query-multiple-conditions) in filters.

* Specify [functions](#query-functions) as a comparison value.

* Set the [sort order](#query-result-sort) for issues in the filter results.

## Query format {#query-format}

To set up a filter using a query language:

1. Open the [**{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_NavigationBar.issue-lists-menu-item }}** page]({{ link-tracker }}issues).

1. Click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/query-language.svg) **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_dashboard_FilterEditor.editor-source-radio-query }}** in the top-right corner.

1. Enter a query and click **Apply**.

General request format:

```no-highlight
"parameter": "value"
```

To set a parameter, start typing its name and select a relevant one from the suggestion. For the full list of parameters, see [Filter parameters](#filter-parameters).

#### Examples {#format-example}

> - Issues that are in the `TEST` queue:
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Queue": "TEST"
>    ```
> - Issues with Alice Little as assignee:
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Assignee": "Alice Little"
>    ```
> - Issues with the `{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.open }}` or `{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.in.progress }}` status.
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Status": "{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.open }}", "{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.status.in.progress }}"
>    ```
> - Issues created from January 1 to January 30, 2017:
>    ```no-highlight
>    "Created": "2017-01-01".."2017-01-30"
>    ```

## Multiple parameter values {#query-multiple-values}

If you want to filter issues by multiple values of the same parameter, use a comma-separated list:
```no-highlight
parameter: "value1" "value2" " value3"
```

#### Example {#multiple-example}

> ```no-highlight
> author: "vpupkin","iivanov"
> ```
> This filter will return all the issues that were reported by `vpupkin` or `iivanov`.

## Filters with multiple conditions {#query-multiple-conditions}

You can combine multiple conditions per filter using logical operators:

- `AND`: Logical **{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.messages.trigger.condition.type.and }}** operator. Conditions combined with this operator must all be met at the same time.

   Example:
   ```no-highlight
   parameter1: "value1" AND parameter2: "value2"
   ```
   This query will return the issues that have `parameter1` set to `value1` **{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.messages.trigger.condition.type.and }}** `parameter2` set to `value2`.

   {% note info %}

   Instead of using the `AND` operator, you can just list the fields separated by a space.

   {% endnote %}

- `OR`: Logical **{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.messages.trigger.condition.type.or }}** operator. At least one of the conditions must be fulfilled.

   Example:
   ```no-highlight
   parameter1: "value1" OR parameter2: "value2"
   ```
   This query will return the issues that have at least one of the conditions met: `parameter1` is set to `value1` **{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.messages.trigger.condition.type.or }}** `parameter2` is set to `value2`.

You can create complex filters by combining multiple operators in a single request:

```no-highlight
parameter1: "value1" AND parameter2: "value2" OR parameter3: "value3"
```

When complex filters are processed, the `AND` operators are applied first. To change the order of actions, use parentheses:

```no-highlight
parameter1: "value1" AND (parameter2: "value2" OR parameter3: "value3")
```

## Searching by text {#query-text}

In addition to searching by parameters, you can use regular text search. To do this, enter text in the query field and click **Apply**.

All the textual fields of the issue are searchable: name, description, and comments.

* To search only in one of the fields, specify it in the parameter:

   * `Summary`: Issue name.

   * `Description`: Issue description.

   * `Comment`: Text in comments.

   * `History`: Text in the history of changes.

   ```no-highlight
   Description: "This area is familiar to me as the outskirts of China"
   ```

   This filter will return all the issues whose descriptions include the words from the original query and their forms.

* To only find issues with text that exactly matches the query text, use the `#` operator:

   ```no-highlight
   Summary: #"Version 2.0"
   ```

   This filter will only return the issues whose name exactly matches the query text.

* To only find issues that contain text exactly matching the query text and additional text, use the `#` operator and add the `||` operator where the additional text is placed:

   ```no-highlight
   Description`: #"Make ||"
   ```

   This filter will only return the issues with text that contains the word "Make" and some more words after it. For example, "Make lists" or "Make a map".

   The `||` operator can only be used together with the `#` operator.

* To only find issues that have no text fragment in a given field, use the `!` operator:

   ```no-highlight
   Summary: !"UI"
   ```

   This filter will only return the issues whose name does not contain a `UI` text fragment.

* To only find issues whose name does not exactly match the query text, use the `~` operator. This operator only applies to the `Summary` field:

   ```no-highlight
   Summary: ~"UI Update 2.0"
   ```

   This filter will only return the issues whose name does not match the query text.

## Searching by user {#query-user}

You can search issues by names and usernames specified in the issue fields. There are several ways to specify names and usernames in queries.

* Username with `@` at the end: `login@`. Use it to search for an exact match containing the username.

   Example:
   ```no-highlight
   Assignee: user3370@
   ```
   This query will display all issues that have `user3370` specified as the assignee. This is the most accurate way to search by user.

* First and last name in quotation marks: `"first_name last_name"`. Use it to search for matches containing the first and last name.

   Example:
   ```no-highlight
   Author: "Alice Little"
   ```
   This query will display all issues that have Alice Little specified as the author. Please note that the output may contain issues of other reporters with username or name similar to `Alice Little`. To avoid this, search by username with the `@` character.

* Name, surname, and username. Use it to search for exact matches containing any of these.

   Examples:

   * `Followers: Alice`. This query will display all issues followed by users with the first name Alice no matter what their last name is.

   * `Followers: alice`. This query will display all issues followed by the user with the username `alice@` or any user named Alice .

## Searching by local field {#local_fields}

To specify a [local issue field](../local-fields.md) in the query, enter the key of the queue to which the field is linked, followed by a dot and the field's name in Russian or English. If the field's name includes several words, enclose the name in double quotes. Examples:

```
DEVS.Tester: "Alice Little"
```
```
DEVS."Lead tester": "Alice Little"
```
```
DEVS.tester: user3370@
```

## Date and time parameters {#query-date-time}

Many issue parameters have the values of date and time. The query language supports several formats for such parameters:

#### Date {#date}

* MM/DD/YYYY

   Example:
   ```
   04/30/2017
   ```

* DD.MM.YYYY

   Example:
   ```
   30.04.2017
   ```

* DD-MM-YYYY

   Example:
   ```
   30-04-2017
   ```

* YYYY-MM-DD

   Example:
   ```
   2017-04-30
   ```

#### Date and time {#date-time}

To specify exact date and time, use the format:
```
"YYYY-MM-DD XXh:XXm:XXs"
```

Example:
```
"2017-04-30 17:25:00"
```

#### Time intervals {#time-intervals}

* You can express time intervals in weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds in the format:
   ```
   "XXw XXd XXh XXm XXs"
   ```

   For example, a time interval of 3 days, 5 hours, and 32 minutes can be expressed as:
   ```
   "3d 5h 32m"
   ```

* You can set intervals using acceptable date formats:
   ```
   DD-MM-YYYY .. DD-MM-YYYY
   ```

   For example, a filter for the issues created within a certain interval:
   ```
   Created: 01-01-2017 .. 02-03-2017
   ```

* Time intervals can be set using [functions](#query-functions) as well as comparison, addition, and subtraction operations.

   For example, a filter for the issues created not earlier than a week and one day ago.

   ```
   Created: > today() - "1w 1d"
   ```

## Comparison operators {#query-compare}

Apart from checking for an exact match, the query language supports the following comparison operations:

* **Not equal to**
   ```no-highlight
   parameter: !"value"
   ```

* **Greater than**, **Less than**, **Less than or equal to**, and **Greater than or equal to**

   The operations accept only numeric and date-and-time parameters.
   ```no-highlight
   parameter: >number
   parameter: <number
   parameter: >=number
   parameter: <=number
   ```

* **In the range**

   The operation only applies to numeric parameters.
   ```no-highlight
   parameter: number1 .. number2
   ```

#### Examples {#compare-example}

Search for issues with a deadline in a few days or today:

> - Issues with a deadline in 3 days:
>    ```no-highlight
>    Deadline: <= today() +3d and deadline: >= today()
>    ```

To customize parameters, use [functions](#query-functions) in a query:

> - Issues with a deadline today:
>    ```no-highlight
>    Deadline: today()
>    ```

## Functions {#query-functions}

In addition to exact parameter values, you can use functions. A function is a variable whose value is calculated at the query runtime. For example, the function `today()` takes the value of today's date. To show all issues created today, use the query:

```no-highlight
Created: today()
```

| Function | Result | Example |
----- | ----- | -----
| ```empty()  ``` | Empty value (no parameter specified) | Find issues that have no assignee specified:<br/>``` Assignee: empty() ``` |
| ```notEmpty() ``` | Any non-empty value (parameter specified) | Find issues that have a deadline set:<br/>``` Deadline: notEmpty() ``` |
| ```me()  ``` | Name of the user running the query | Find issues created by you:<br/>``` Author: me() ``` |
| ```now() ``` | Current time with to-the-minute precision | Find issues created in the last 12 hours:<br/>``` Created: >now()-12h ``` |
| ```today() ``` | Time interval corresponding to current date | Find issues created today:<br/>``` Created: today() ``` |
| ```week() ``` | Date interval corresponding to current week | Find issues created this week:<br/>``` Created: week() ``` |
| ```month()  ``` | Date interval corresponding to current month | Find issues created this month:<br/>``` Created: month() ``` |
| ```quarter()  ``` | Date interval corresponding to current quarter | Find issues created in this quarter:<br/>``` Created: quarter() ``` |
| ```year() ``` | Date interval corresponding to current year | Find issues created this year:<br/>``` Created: year() ``` |
| ```unresolved() ``` | Issues without a resolution | Find all issues that have no resolution:<br/>``` Resolution: unresolved() ``` |
| ```group() ``` | List of the department's employees | Find issues that employees of the Sales department are working on:<br/>``` Assignee: group(value: "Sales department")  ```<br/>**Note:** If a group to select from contains more than 1,000 users, the query will only search across 1,000 users. Moreover, it is not known beforehand which users will be selected, as you cannot manage this process. |


## Searching by parameter change {#query-change}

If you know when and how the issue parameter was changed, you can use these criteria in the filter:
```
"parameter": changed(from: "old value" to: "new value" by: "who changed" date: "when changed")
```

For example, to get a list of the issues that the user Alice Little changed to the <q>In Progress</q> status over a certain period of time, create the query:

```
Status: changed(to: "In progress" by: "Alice Little" date: 01.09.2017 .. 15.09.2017)
```

To get a list of issues that the user Alice Little changed to the <q>In progress</q> status over the past week, use the following [function](#query-functions) in your query:

```
Status: changed(to: "In progress" by: "Alice Little" date: >today()-1w)>
```

## Sorting results {#query-result-sort}

You can sort filter results by adding `"Sort By"` at the end of the query. Specify the name of the sort field as a value:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created
```

If necessary, sort in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created ASC
```

To specify several sort fields, list them through a comma in the priority order:

```no-highlight
"Sort By": Created ASC, Updated DESC
```

## Useful queries {#useful-queries}

Try to run some ready-made queries to get a better idea of how they work:

* Active issues whose reporter you are:
   ```no-highlight
   Author: me() Resolution: empty()
   ```

* Active issues that were assigned to you:
   ```no-highlight
   Assignee: me() Resolution: empty()
   ```

* Active issues that you follow:
   ```no-highlight
   Followers: me() Resolution: empty()
   ```

* Issues where you are an assignee and deadline is due within a week:
   ```no-highlight
   Assignee: me() Deadline: week()
   ```

* Issues with the **Critical** or **Blocker** priority for which you are the reporter, assignee, or follower:
   ```no-highlight
   (Followers: me() OR Assignee: me() OR Author: me()) AND Resolution: empty() AND Priority: Blocker, Critical
   ```
