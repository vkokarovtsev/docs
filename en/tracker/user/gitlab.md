# {{ GL }}

## Setting up a link {#relation}


In [{{ tracker-name }} issues](../about-tracker.md#zadacha), you can automatically add links to [Merge Requests]({{ gl.docs }}/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) from {{ GL }}. To do this, specify the appropriate issue's [key](../glossary.md#key) in the name or description of a new Merge Request. The links will be placed in [{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_issue-links_ExternalLinksCollapse.external-relations}}](../external-links.md).

You can also enable automatic creation of issue comments with information about Merge Requests. Auto comments are only available for [{{ mgl-name }}](../../managed-gitlab/).

Private repositories can only be accessed by users logged in to GitLab (**Internal project**) or the project team (**Private project**).

{% endnote %}

1. {% include [make sure you are admin](../../_includes/tracker/make-sure-admin.md) %}
