# Adding an issue field

## Standard issue fields {#default-fields}

The most popular issue fields (settings) are available in {{ tracker-name }} by default. You can see the list of existing fields on the [Settings {{ tracker-name }}]({{ link-admin-fields }}) page.

If you can't find a relevant parameter among them, you can [create a new field in your queue](#section_local_field). If you want to add a field that will be available in all {{ tracker-name }} queues,  admin can [create a global field](#section_global_field).

## Local fields {#section_local_field}

If you need to add a new issue field that is not available in {{ tracker-name }}, you can add local fields to your queue.

A local field can only be used in the issues of the queue it's linked to. The advantage of local fields is that the queue owner can manage them without the risk of affecting the workflows in other queues. Users working in other queues will not see this field in their issues.

For more information about creating and using local fields, see [{#T}](../local-fields.md).

{% note alert %}

Local fields are temporarily not supported in certain cases. Such support will be implemented later. For more information, see [Local field constraints](../local-fields.md#restrictions).

{% endnote %}

## Global fields {#section_global_field}

### Adding a global field {#add_global_field}


{% note alert %}

Only an [administrator](../role-model.md) can add global fields.

{% endnote %}

To add a new issue field (parameter):

1. Make sure you are authorized as an [administrator](../role-model.md).

1. On the left-hand panel, select ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/admin.svg) **Admin settings** → **{{ tracker-name }} setting** .

1. Click the **Fields** tab.

1. Click **Create field**.

1. Select the field type and click **Continue**.

1. Set parameters for a new field:
   * **Category**: All {{ tracker-name }} fields are grouped into categories. Select the category that best suits the new field.

   * **Name**: Try to give short and concise names to your fields.

   * **Name in English**: This name is shown in the English interface of {{ tracker-name }}.

   * **Type of number** (only for the <q>Number</q> fields).

   * **List items** (only for the <q>Drop-down list</q> fields): Enter the possible values and their order.

   * **Item selection** (only for the <q>Drop-down list</q> fields).

   * **Number of employees** (only for the <q>User list</q> fields).

1. Click **Create**.



### Edit a global field {#edit_global_field}

Editing the parameters of a global issue field isn't supported in the {{ tracker-name }} web interface. For this purpose, use requests to {{ api-name }}:

* HTTP request for [renaming a global field](../concepts/issues/patch-issue-field-name.md).

* HTTP request for [changing the acceptable values of a global field](../concepts/issues/patch-issue-field-value.md).

### Delete a global field {#delete_global_field}

You can't delete a global field, but you can hide it in the {{ tracker-name }} interface. For this, in the body of the request to {{ api-name }} for [changing the global field](../concepts/issues/patch-issue-field-value.md), set the `hidden` parameter to `true`.

You can't add a hidden field to an issue using the right panel.
