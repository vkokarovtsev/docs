# Setting up a billing account

You need a {{ yandex-cloud }} billing account to pay your invoices for using {{ tracker-name }} if [full access](access.md) to the platform is granted to six or more users. Your billing account linked to {{ tracker-name }} will be [debited monthly](pay-the-bill.md#charge) for using the service. To learn more about service plans and take a look at some examples of how to calculate monthly costs, see [Pricing policy](pricing.md).

You can find the FAQ for payments in [{#T}](payment.md).

Billing accounts are managed by an administrator. You can use your existing billing account from {{ yandex-cloud }} or create a new, dedicated, billing account for {{ tracker-name }}.

## Link a billing account {{ yandex-cloud }} {#bind}

If you use {{ yandex-cloud }} services and want to use the same billing account to pay for {{ tracker-name }} services, link this account to {{ tracker-name }}.

You cannot link billing accounts that have debts or are in the `Suspended` [status](../billing/concepts/billing-account-statuses.md).

If you link a billing account with a valid [trial period](../getting-started/free-trial/concepts/quickstart.md), the paid version will be automatically activated for it. The account will start getting debited after the initial grant is used up or the trial period expires.

To link a billing account:
1. Open the [{{ tracker-name }} page]({{ link-tracker }}) and [log in to the admin account](user/login.md).
1. Go to **Admin** → **Billing**. The page shows all your billing accounts from {{ yandex-cloud }}.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_page-admin_BillingAccountList.bind }}** next to the relevant billing account.

{% note warning %}

If different users are responsible for {{ tracker-name }} and billing account administration, the {{ tracker-name }} admin will only be able to link a billing account if they have the `billing.accounts.admin` or `billing.accounts.editor` role in the {{ org-full-name }} organization's [cloud](../organization/concepts/manage-services.md#cloud). [Learn more about {{ billing-name }} roles](../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md#billing-roles).
