# Creating an HR management queue

To enable the HR department employees to plan and track general HR tasks, create a queue and invite them to it:

1. Create a queue:
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![](../_assets/tracker/svg/queues-ni.svg) **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_TrackerSearch.queues }}** â†’ **Create queue**.
   1. Select the basic **Start now** queue template.
   1. Give the queue a name, e.g., `HR Tasks`.
   1. Click **Create**.
1. Add the HR department staff to the [queue team](manager/queue-team.md).
1. You can also configure access [rights to issues within the queue](manager/queue-access.md) if needed. For example, you can restrict certain groups of users from creating or viewing issues in your queue.
1. If different HR experts are responsible for recruitment and employee follow-up, you can create multiple queues with access control so that the staff of one department does not see the issues of another.
1. Create a test issue:
   1. Click ![](../_assets/tracker/svg/icon-add.svg) **Create issue** in the left panel.
   1. In the **Issue name** field of the form that opens, enter an issue name, such as `Review meeting on the progress of current {{ tracker-name }} issues`.
   1. Click **Create**.
