# Changing multiple issues

You can change the statuses and parameters of multiple issues at once. To open a list of issues, go to the queue page or filter page.

## Changing the status {#change-status}

To change the issue status:

1. Open the issue list.

1. Check the box ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/check.svg) next to the issues you want to change.

   If you want to select all the issues on the queue or filter page at once, check the box ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/check.svg) above the list of issues.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_IssueBulkActionPanel.change-status }}** under the issue list and select the status.

   Only status transitions that are included in the [workflow](workflow.md) are available for bulk change. If you select a status change that is available only to part of the issues, only this part will change their status.

1. After the operation is complete, in the bottom-right corner, you will see a notification with the number of issues with changed status.

   To see a list of issues that cannot be changed to the selected status, click **More** in the notification.

## Move an issues to another queue {#change-queue}

To edit the issue queue:

1. Open the issue list.

1. Check the box ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/check.svg) next to the issues you want to move.

   If you want to select all the issues on the queue or filter page at once, check the box ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/check.svg) above the list of issues.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_IssueBulkActionPanel.move }}** under the issue list.

1. Select the queue that the issues will be moved to.

1. When the operation is complete, in the bottom-right corner, you'll see a notification with the number of issues moved to another queue.

   To see a list of issues that cannot be moved, click **More** in the notification. The issues that are in the selected queue already, cannot be moved.

Once moved to another queue, the issues are assigned new keys. Links to the issue using the old key remain valid. When following such a link, the issue automatically opens in the new queue. However, you will not be able to find the issue by the old key using a [filter](../manager/quick-filters.md) or a [query](../user/query-filter.md#query-format.md).

## Adding a link {#add-links}

To add a link to multiple issues at once:

1. Open the issue list.

1. Click **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_IssueBulkActionPanel.add-link }}** under the list of issues, select the [link type](../user/links.md), and create the link:

   * To create an issue, click the **New issue** tab. Give your issue a name and press **Enter**.
