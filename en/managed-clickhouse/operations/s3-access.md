# Configuring access to {{ objstorage-name }} from a {{ CH }} cluster

{{ mch-name }} supports using {{ objstorage-full-name }} to:
* Enable [ML models](ml-models.md), [data format schemas](format-schemas.md), and your [own geobase](geobase.md).
* Process data that is stored in object storage if this data is represented in any of the [supported {{ CH }} formats]({{ ch.docs }}/interfaces/formats/).

To access {{ objstorage-name }} [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) data from a cluster, set up password-free access to the bucket using a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md):

1. [Connect a service account to a cluster](#connect-service-account).
1. [Set up access rights for the service account](#configure-acl).
1. [Get a link to the bucket object](#get-link-to-object), which you can use to perform operations with the cluster data.

See [Examples of working with objects](#examples).

## Connecting a service account to a cluster {#connect-service-account}

1. When [creating](cluster-create.md) or [updating](update.md) a cluster, either select an existing service account or create a new one.

1. Make sure that this account is assigned the correct roles from the `storage.*` role group. If needed, assign it the necessary roles, e.g., `storage.viewer` and `storage.uploader`.

{% note tip %}

To link {{ mch-name }} clusters to {{ objstorage-name }}, it's recommended to use service accounts specially created for this purpose. This lets you organize work with any buckets, including those for which public access is undesirable or impossible.

{% endnote %}

## Setting up access rights {#configure-acl}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the bucket is located. If there is no bucket, [create](../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md) one and [populate](../../storage/operations/objects/upload.md) it with the required data.

   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_storage }}**.

   1. Set up the [bucket ACL](../../storage/operations/buckets/edit-acl.md) or [object ACL](../../storage/operations/objects/edit-acl.md):

      1. In the list of buckets or objects, select the required object and click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg).
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.buckets.button_permissions }}** or **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.file.button_permissions }}**.
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.acl-dialog.label_select-placeholder }}** drop-down list, specify the service account [connected to the cluster](#connect-service-account).
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.add }}**.
      1. Set the required permissions for the service account from the drop-down list.
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.

      {% note info %}

      If necessary, revoke access from one or more users by clicking **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.acl-dialog.button_remove-new }}** in the appropriate line.

      {% endnote %}

## Getting a link to an object {#get-link-to-object}

To use {{ mch-name }} to work with data of an object in {{ objstorage-name }}, you need to [get a link](../../storage/operations/objects/link-for-download.md) to this object in the bucket.

A link, such as `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/<object_name>?X-Amz-Algorithm=...` should be changed to `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/<object_name>`. To do this, delete all parameters in the query string.

## Examples of working with objects {#examples}

[You can use object links](#get-link-to-object) in `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/<object_name>` format to work with geotags and schemas or to use the `s3` table function and the `S3` table engine.

The `S3` table engine is similar to [File]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/special/file/) and [URL]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/special/url/) engines, except that data is stored in S3-compatible storage (such as {{ objstorage-full-name }}) rather than using a file system or a remote HTTP/HTTPS server. This engine allows reading or writing data from/to storage using standard SQL queries such as `SELECT` and `INSERT`.

The `s3` table function provides the same functionality as the `S3` table engine, but you don't need to create a table before using it.

For example, if the {{ objstorage-name }} bucket has a `table.tsv` file that stores table data in TSV format, then you can create a table or function that will work with this file. You must set up password-free access and obtain a link to the `table.tsv` file first.

{% list tabs %}

- S3 table

   1. Create a table:

      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE test (n Int32) ENGINE = S3('https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/table.tsv', 'TSV');
      ```

   1. Run test queries to the table:

      ```sql
      INSERT INTO test VALUES (1);
      SELECT * FROM test;

      ┌─n─┐
      │ 1 │
      └───┘
      ```

- S3 function

   1. Insert data:

      ```sql
      INSERT INTO FUNCTION s3('https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/table.tsv', 'TSV', 'n Int32') VALUES (1);
      ```

   1. Run a test query:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM s3('https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/table.tsv', 'TSV', 'n Int32');

      ┌─n─┐
      │ 1 │
      └───┘
      ```
