# Managing shards in a {{ CH }} cluster

You can group several [shards](../concepts/sharding.md) of a {{ CH }} cluster in a _shard group_ and save tables in this group.

## Listing shard groups in a cluster {#list-shard-groups}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-clickhouse }}**.
   1. Click the cluster name and open the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.clickhouse.cluster.switch_shard-groups }}** tab.

- CLI

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To get a list of shard groups in a cluster, run the command:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-ch }} shard-groups list \
      --cluster-name=<cluster_name>
   ```

   You can request the cluster name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   To get a list of shard groups in a cluster, use the [listShardGroups](../api-ref/Cluster/listShardGroups.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/ListShardGroups](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#ListShardGroups) gRPC API call and provide the cluster ID in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

{% endlist %}

## Viewing detailed information about a shard group {#get-shard-group}

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-clickhouse }}**.

     --name=<shard_group_name>
   ```

   You can request the cluster name with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   To get detailed information about a shard group, use the [getShardGroup](../api-ref/Cluster/getShardGroup.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/GetShardGroup](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#GetShardGroup) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:
   * The cluster ID, in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API

   To create a shard group, use the [createShardGroup](../api-ref/Cluster/createShardGroup.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/CreateShardGroup](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#CreateShardGroup) gRPC API call and provide the following in the request:
   * ID of the cluster in which you want to create a group, in the `clusterId` parameter. To find out the cluster ID, [get a list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
   * Name of the shard group, in the `shardGroupName` parameter.
   * List of shard names be included in the group, in the `shardNames` parameter. To find out the names, [get a list of shards](shards.md#list-shards) in the cluster.

## Deleting a group of shards {#delete-shard-group}

Deleting a group of shards doesn't affect the shards in the group: they are kept in the cluster.

Tables created on the deleted group are kept, but they are disabled and attempts to query them result in errors. However, you can delete these tables before or after you delete the shard group.
