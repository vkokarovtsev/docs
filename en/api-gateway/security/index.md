description: "Access management in {{ api-gw-full-name }}, an API gateway service with OpenAPI 3.0 support.

# Access management in {{ api-gw-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If a user does not have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to {{ api-gw-name }} resources (API gateways), assign the Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), or [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md) the required roles from the list below. Currently, a role can be [assigned](../../iam/operations/roles/grant.md) for a parent resource (folder or cloud) or an organization.

Only users with the `admin`, `resource-manager.clouds.owner`, or `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role for a resource can assign roles for this resource.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.
